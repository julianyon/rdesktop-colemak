! I use a US Colemak layout with a UK keyboard. These have an extra key
! over the US models, which can be used for Compose. It's also a reasonable
! place to reinstate Caps Lock, which I have to use on occasion due to a
! disability which affects my typing.

! My X installation doesn't include a Compose binding for â‰ˆ (approxeq) but
